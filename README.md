# GToTree: a user-friendly workflow for phylogenomics
[GToTree](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/GToTree.wiki) is a user-friendly workflow for phylogenomics intended to give more researchers the capability to create phylogenomic trees.

**See the [conda quickstart](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/GToTree/wiki/installation#conda-quickstart) installation page to have things up and running in just a couple steps!**

GToTree is a more structured implementation of a workflow I would put together everytime I wanted to make a large-scale phylogenomic tree. What do I mean by large-scale? Anything from a full-blown Tree of Life with all 3 domains, down to, for example, all available genomes of *Staphylococcus* alongside new isolate genomes. At its heart it just takes in genomes and outputs an alignment and phylogenomic tree based on the specified HMM profiles. But I think its value comes from three main things: 1) its flexibility with regard to input format - taking fasta files, GenBank files, and/or NCBI accessions (So if you just recovered a bunch of new genomes and you want to see where they fit in with references, you can provide references by accession and your new genomes as fasta files.); 2) its automation of required between-tool tasks such as filtering hits by gene-length, filtering out genomes with too few hits to the target genes, and swapping genome labels for something more useful; and 3) its scalability â€“ GToTree can turn ~1,700 input genomes into a tree in ~60 minutes on a standard laptop.

Also included are several newly generated single-copy gene-sets for 13 different taxonomical groupings. These are presented in the [wiki](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/GToTree/wiki/SCG-sets), along with an explanation and example code/steps used in the generation of them. 

GToTree utilizes helper scripts written in python, but is primarily implemented in bash. Every attempt is being made to make it portable across all variations of GNU/Unix, including on Macs, so if you run into any issues, it'd be appreciated if you could [report them](https://github.com/AstrobioMike/GToTree/issues) so the problems can be found and fixed!

## Dependencies (the conda installation takes care of all of these)
### Required to use at all:
If you use GToTree, please cite these folks :)  

- **[Biopython](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download)** - [citation](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/11/1422/330687)
- **[HMMER3](http://hmmer.org/download.html)** - citation: they note in the [user manual](http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/Userguide.pdf) to cite the website, but there is also [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002195)  
- **[Muscle](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm)** - [citation](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/32/5/1792/2380623)

- **[FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/)** - [citation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009490)  

### Required based on inputs and options:
If you use GToTree in a manner that uses these tools, please cite these folks :)  

- **[Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal)** - [citation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848648/)  
  - *if providing input genomes in fasta format, or GenBank format with no CDS annotations, or NCBI accessions to genomes with no gene calls*
- **[TaxonKit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/taxonkit/)** - citation: I'm not sure how to cite them yet
  - *if changing genome labels based on lineage information for input genomes with associated NCBI taxids*
- **[GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)** - [citation info](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/parallel_design.html#Citation-notice)
  - *if running in parallel*

## Testing instructions for those of you kind enough to be helping me squash da bugs
In the "test\_data" directory there are example files and an "example\_run\_log" with versions of running the program that should work. If things do not work, please let me know what happened. If it does work, please start changing the inputs and use as you might to help find da bugs :)

Running `GToTree` with no arguments gives the help menu.
