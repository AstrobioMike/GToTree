    # currently working on ko searching, the "additional_ko_searching.py" module and "search-kos.smk"
        # loosely following "hmm_searching.py" and "search-hmms.smk" for inspiration

    # for the pfam/ko searching, maybe i should cat all genome-AA files together into one file, so then i can do the search once on all of them...
        # or i can make them snakemake wfs and do one search per genome with a counter...
            # i like this idea better for now
        # i started working through pfams
        # add check if pfam hmms already grabbed, and skip that part if so

    # optional pfam search 
        # perform this on all genomes still, after preprocessing before SCG search
    # optional ko search
        # perform this on all genomes still, after preprocessing before SCG search

    # maybe *don't* make --resume be auto (despite my earlier idea), stop and tell the user to specify --resume or -F if the output dir exists
        # and note that resume is only for resuming, all needs to be the same; it's not for modifying and re-running anything
        # need to build in something to check nothing changed at a resume start

    # maybe add an ext variable somewhere (could be in run_data) so when working with amino acids we have .faa, and .fa when nucleotides in tmp outputs
        # right now i just did .fasta so it covers both
        # final outputs are named appropriately

    # test/look into message.get_path_rel_to_outdir()
        # what happens when the output dir i provide to the gtotree call is a full path?
        # check out what happens if there are multiple matches to key_dir in messaging.get_path_rel_to_outdir()
            # e.g., if we are in a directory called gtotree-output and the output directory is also gtotree-output
            # might need to adjust this (maybe even just searching for the last match, rather than any (or first from reverse order will work)

    # go through general.py GenomeData class and see which methods i put in that i'm not using anywhere anymore

    # implement nucleotide mode :(
    # unit tests..... :( :( :(

### OVERALL NOTES ###
# add a stop at "Summary of input-genome preprocessing" to check there are 3 or more as needed to make a tree
# need a lot of testing on "resume" functionality
    # if i count on the resume flag for operating, i may need to make sure it makes sense up front (like does the run-data.json exist)
# need some check and handling if the input files changed when doing a resume
    # maybe just check and require they haven't changed at all, if so a totally new run is needed
# when a resume is done, may want to just try snakemake workflows on inputs that failed the prior runs
# since multiple logs may be created with --resume function, might need to add functionality to back up a log that exists to a sub-dir,
    # maybe with a time/date stamp of when first run appended to the name
# eventually look into putting a block for this prodigal failure: "at least 100000 bases for training." (search original files)
    # maybe just make a check that input genomes are greater than 100,000 bases (if that consistently triggers it)
# eventually add a check that nucleotide fasta inputs are nucleotide and not amino acid, and vice versa
# eventually do something with gunzipped files we generated (probably delete them, leaving the originals)

### TO DO ###

# switch to only using http when available
    # affects:
        # get_ncbi_assembly_tables.py (DONE)
        # ncbi assembly downloads (DONE)
        # kofamscan data is only available via ftp (maybe host this somewhere else for GToTree; it rarely if ever changes)


### CHANGES ###

# default output changed to "gtotree-output"
# default lineage settings are D,P,C,S (no longer strain)
# http is used instead of ftp always where available (used to be ftp by default with http option)
# several output files and dirs had underscores changed to dashes (sorry, i now hate underscores when they're not necessary)
# estimated percent completion and redundancy are no long provided
    # (this was always just "free" info, but checkm2 is a much better way to do this, so i made the decision to stop providing it at all)
# --resume flag added (will be set automatically if the same output dir but no `-F` flag provided)
# taxids are no longer searched for in input genbank files, they will only be found/used for provided input ncbi-accessions
    # if this is actually a feature that benefitted anyone, i'll add it back in upon request :)
# the order of processing changed slightly from v1 to v2, so the output report messages vary a little
    # in v1, each genome was downloaded/parsed and scanned for the target genes in one pass
    # in v2, all input genomes are prepared for each input source, then all are searched together
# there are no longer separate summary tables for each input-genome source (accessions, fasta files, genbank files, and amino-acid files)
    # they are all represented in the primary "genomes-summary-info.tsv" table, which includes a "source" column

### PLACES TO DEF IMPROVE ###


### IMPROVEMENTS to highlight in paper ###

# python packaging and structure (rather than 4,000 lines of bash as main runner with dozens of individual python helper scripts)
# instead of just exiting and informing when input files have problems, GToTree2 fixes them
    # e.g., duplicate entries will be unique'd, windows line-endings will be converted, changes written to a new file that is then used
# snakemake control over the main components for easier restart capabilities
# things i've added over time
    # gtt-gen-SCG-HMMs
    # gtt-get-GTDB-accessions
    # gtt-subset...
    # new prepackaged HMMs based on GTDB taxonomy
    # in tandem scanning of target KOs or pfams, files for added vizualization in iToL
    # pre-built HMMs stored remotely and downloaded when used, to slim package size and install time
    # partitions.txt file produced suitable for mixed-model treeing like with iqtree


### """
# In its first 6 years, the original GToTree received over 500 citations and has been
# successfully continually maintained over this time despite its foundation being a main runner 
# of ~4,000 lines of BASH and dozens of independent python and BASH helper scripts with a lot 
# of redundancy in its code base. Among several other improvements and feature additions, GToTree 
# has now been rewritten from the ground up in python with its major stages being powered by 
# Snakemake workflows - enabling the resuming of failed or interrupted runs. This paper highlights
# some of the new additions to GToTree since its initial launch.
