### OVERALL NOTES ### 
# execute snakemake workflows from within the output gtotree dir (so .snakemake dirs won't ever conflict with each other)


### TO DO ###

# add checks for mapping file (preflight_checks.py)

# switch to only using http when available 
    # affects:
        # get_ncbi_assembly_tables.py (DONE)
        # ncbi assembly downloads
        # kofamscan data is only available via ftp (maybe host this somewhere else for GToTree)



### CHANGES ###

# default output changed to "gtotree-output"
# default lineage settings are D,P,C,S (no longer strain)
# http is used instead of ftp always where available (used to be ftp by default with http option)
# several output files and dirs had underscores changed to dashes (sorry, i now hate underscores when they're not necessary)


### IMPROVEMENTS to highlight in paper ###

# python packaging and structure (rather than 4,000 lines of bash as main runner with dozens of individual python helper scripts)
# instead of just exiting and informing when input files have problems, GToTree2 fixes them
    # e.g., duplicate entries will be unique'd, windows line-endings will be converted, changes written to a new file that is then used
# snakemake control over the main components for easier restart capabilities
# things i've added over time
    # gtt-gen-SCG-HMMs
    # gtt-get-GTDB-accessions
    # gtt-subset...
    # new prepackaged HMMs based on GTDB taxonomy
    # in tandem scanning of target KOs or pfams, files for added vizualization in iToL

### """
# In its first 6 years, the original GToTree received over 500 citations and had tens of thousands of Conda installs. It has been
# successfully used and maintained over this time, despite its foundation being a main runner of ~4,000 lines of BASH and dozens of independent python
# and BASH helper scripts with a lot of redundancy in its code base. This was purely a consequence of my capabilities at the time.
